# Break Timer
Don't forget to take breaks!

This application allows you to define how long you want to spend working before taking a break.
Once the time runs out, the program will alert you to take a break via a popup.

This project was originally developed based on my own needs to have such an app and to learn how to create a client Windows app using WPF.
